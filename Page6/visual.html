	<h1>What is Data Visualisation?</h1>

<h2>The beauty of an art lies in the message it conveys. At times, reality is not what we see or perceive. The endless efforts from the likes of Vinci and Picasso have tried to bring people closer to the reality using their exceptional artworks on a certain topic/matter.</h2>

<h2>Data scientists are no less than artists. They make paintings in form of digital visualization (of data) with a motive of manifesting the hidden patterns / insights in it. It is even more interesting to know that, the tendency of human perception, cognition and communication increases when he / she gets exposed to visualized form of any content/data.</h2>

<h2>There are multiple tools for performing visualization in data science. In this article, I have demonstrated various visualization charts using Python.</h2>

	<h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">What does it take to make visualization in Python?</h2>
	<p>Not much ! Python has already made it easy for you â€“ with two exclusive libraries for visualization, commonly known as matplotlib and seaborn. Heard of them?</p>
