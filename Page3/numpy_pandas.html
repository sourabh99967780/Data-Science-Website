	<h1>Numpy and Pandas</h1>
	<p class="top">What are these things and how are they related to Data Science?</p>
	<p class="top">Python provides two data anlytics libraries named
		<a class="numpy_pandas" href="http://www.numpy.org/">Numpy</a> and <a class="numpy_pandas" href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a></p>

      <h2>Numpy</h2>
      <p>NumPy is a Python package. It stands for 'Numerical Python'. It is a library consisting of multidimensional array objects and a collection of routines for processing of array.

Numeric, the ancestor of NumPy, was developed by Jim Hugunin. Another package Numarray was also developed, having some additional functionalities. In 2005, Travis Oliphant created NumPy package by incorporating the features of Numarray into Numeric package. There are many contributors to this open source project.</p>
		<h2>Operations using NumPy</h2>
		<p>
			Using NumPy, a developer can perform the following operations −</p>
<ul>
	<li>Mathematical and logical operations on arrays.</li>

	<li>Fourier transforms and routines for shape manipulation.</li>

<li>Operations related to linear algebra. NumPy has in-built functions for linear algebra and random number generation.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>NumPy – A Replacement for MatLab</h2>
<p>NumPy is often used along with packages like SciPy (Scientific Python) and Mat−plotlib (plotting library). This combination is widely used as a replacement for MatLab, a popular platform for technical computing. However, Python alternative to MatLab is now seen as a more modern and complete programming language.

      <h2 id="testimonials">Pandas</h2>
      <p>&ldquo;Pandas is an open-source Python Library providing high-performance data manipulation and analysis tool using its powerful data structures. The name Pandas is derived from the word Panel Data – an Econometrics from Multidimensional data.

In 2008, developer Wes McKinney started developing pandas when in need of high performance, flexible tool for analysis of data.

Prior to Pandas, Python was majorly used for data munging and preparation. It had very little contribution towards data analysis. Pandas solved this problem. Using Pandas, we can accomplish five typical steps in the processing and analysis of data, regardless of the origin of data — load, prepare, manipulate, model, and analyze.

Python with Pandas is used in a wide range of fields including academic and commercial domains including finance, economics, Statistics, analytics, etc.&ldquo;</p>
