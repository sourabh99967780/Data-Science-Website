	<h1>Introduction to Data Science!</h1>

<h2>It is the civil engineering of data. Its acolytes have a practical knowledge of materials and tools joined with a theoretical understanding of what is feasible. Data science is a technique to change the raw data into information. It is the study of where the valuable data comes from, what it represents and how it can be turned into a valuable resource in the creation of business and IT strategies.</h2>

<p>Data Scientist = <dfn data-info="A programmer is an individual that writes/creates computer software or applications by giving the computer specific programming instructions.">Programmer</dfn> + <dfn data-info="A computer scientist is a person who has acquired the knowledge of computer science, the study of the theoretical foundations of information and computation and their application.">Computer Scientist</dfn> + <dfn data-info="A mathematician is someone who uses an extensive knowledge of mathematics in his or her work, typically to solve mathematical problems.">Mathematician</dfn> + <dfn data-info="Narrator, a storyteller within a story">Story Teller</dfn> + <dfn data-info="A subject-matter expert (SME) or domain expert is a person who is an authority in a particular area or topic.">Domain Expert</dfn></p>
	
	<h1>Future aspects of Data Science!</h1>

<p>I wouldn’t give fancy statements like <dfn style="font-weight: bold;" data-info="It is! though">“The sexiest job of the 21st century”</dfn> which you probably already know or have heard before but I would rather try my best to focus this answer on providing the facts and real information that you probably do not know by now!</p>
	<p>No matter how appealing this job profiles seems, it does demand a lot of sweat and blood to understand and learn it. Trust me when I say this being a Data Scientist myself- Do not opt for this career just because you are attracted to the huge salary figures or because it is the sexiest job of the 21st century. I have seen a lot of friends opting for it just because of the good salary figures or appeal related to the job title and later regretting choosing it because they couldn’t get it.

I have no intention of demotivating you but my only motive it to make you come terms with the reality of this job profile. And since you have asked about this job profile, I am assuming that you might be interested in opting for it.

Data science involves the job of discovering valuable insights from a massive amount of unstructured and structured data for helping shape up of meet the specific goals and requirements of a business.

These days businesses depend almost entirely on data analysis for driving the decision making and machine learning work as the major components of the IT strategies. As a result the demand for good data scientist is growing consistently since a long period of time.</p>

		<h2>So, what is the demand of data science in future?</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>The IT industry is expecting to add around 180000–200000 fresh job vacancies that are related to recent technologies like Data Science and Machine Learning</li>
			<li>This job profile offers great opportunities to freshers who have the relevant skills and they have an extremely bright future ahead</li>
			<li>A large no. of Indian developers are running towards data science since it the most in-trend job role and is expected to have a great future ahead as well.</li>
			<li>As per TeamLease Services - a popular staffing solutions co. - by the year <b>“2020, India will face a demand-supply gap of 2,00,00 data analytics professionals”</b></li>
